                Alfred Hitchcock to Make At Least $5 Million for ‘Psycho’
            </div>
            <div>

            <div class="column">
                <div>It was disclosed In New York this week that the Alfred Hitchcock will walk away
                        with a profit of at least $5,000,000 from his “Psycho” entry.
                       This is gross income, i.e., before the Internal Revenue 1040
                       statement, but nonetheless a tidy amount of coin for an
                       enterprise that took about nine months of his time and effort.</div>  
                <div>Hitchcock’s grand slam is unprecedented, according 
                        to executives in the trade’s economic know.</div>     
                <div>Hitchcock’s deal with Paramount, as financier and distributor of 
                        “Psycho,” gives him roughly 60% of the negative ownership. The 
                        financial arrangement is a complicated one—to the extent that 
                        even the insiders prefer not to discuss it unless flanked by a 
                        couple of lawyers.</div> 
                <div>But the basic consideration is that Hitchcock deferred any kind
                        of straight salary in favor of the 60% ownership. Film, a shocker
                        starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh and Vera Miles, was brought 
                        in at a cost of slightly over $1,000,000. The stake would have 
                        beenhigher had it not been for the deferment. But, still, it’s 
                        regarded as an inexpensive “A” in the present lush-budget era.</div>

                    <div>High and low life in modern Rome are seen through the eyes of a reporter, 
                    Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni), whose beat brings him into contact with 
                    a world-famous film star (Anita Ekberg); with an unhappy and over-rich 
                    nymphomanic society girl (Anouk Aimee);
                    with a false miracle 'announced' 
                    by two lying children and exploited by press and TV; with the suicide of 
                    an intellectual (Alain Cuny) whom he's always idolized; with a debauched 
                    and tired party in a nobleman's castle peopled by ghosts of past and 
                    present; and finally, with an orgy (complete with a striptease performed 
                    by the hostess) staged in a futile search for excitement by a grostesque 
                    assortment of youths and grownups of all sexes. All the while, the reporter
                     refuses the advances of the only woman (Yvonne Furneaux) who really loves him.</div>

                            Accepting his second award for best director for his work on The Revenant,
                                Alejandro G Iñárritu briefly touched upon the need for diversity before
                                being drowned out by music in order to keep the ceremony running on time.

                            In a year of #OscarsSoWhite, a Mexican film-maker quietly dominates the Academy
                         Awards. Shortly following his win, Iñárritu – who also took the prize for 
                         directing Birdman last year – was asked to elaborate on his comments backstage.
                        </div>
                <div>
                        Iñárritu attacked “tribal thinking”, saying:“I think one of the problems that
                        we are suffering is there are no moderate platforms to talk about something
                        deeply, very important, that in a way is deciding the destinies of people 
                        around the world – not only here – by the colour of their skin. So that we 
                        are still dragging those prejudices and tribal thinking at this time? It 
                        seems to me absolutely absurd.”
                </div>
                <div>
                            “The Revenant – Alejandro González Iñárritu, his writers – they’re all 
                        Mexican. So where are they in the diversity conversation?” he asked during a 
                        press conference.

                             The Latino presence at Sunday’s ceremony was notable: on top of 
                            ñárritu’s victory, Mexican cinematographer  won his third Oscar in
                            row for his work on The Revenant, after wins for Gravity and Birdman.
